# Recommedations
Based on the analysis here are actionable insights for microsoft's new movie studios.

To focus on high-grossing Genres this means that microsoft should prioritize producing films in genres that are consistently performing well, such as Drama,Comedy,Comedy|Drama,Drama|Mystery and Suspense,Art house and International|Drama,Action and Adventures|Drama. As we have seen from our analysis these genres are among the best performing genres.
To focus on the target key demographic, as per our rating distribution we have seen the best rated are Restricted (R) and Not rated(NR). So Microsoft should focus on developing content that appeals to core demographics,particularly the 18-34 age group since the ristricted movies only produce contents for people over the age of 18 and above and this age group are the most frequent moviegoers. They should also consider intergrating diverse and inclusive storyline to attract a wider audience.
Should Balance budgets and quality - They should aim for a balance between production quality and budget. As we have seen from our analysis mid range budget films with a strong storytelling can be highly profitable and this was well portrait by Return On Investment (ROI) from our analysis. They should avoid over-relying on high-budget productions unless they have a very high probability of success and these was well portrait on worldwide gross analysis.
Emphasize critical acclaim - Microsoft should strive for strong critical and audience reception and invest in quality screenwriting,direction and production to generate positive reviews which can boost long-term box office performance as we saw from our reveiw analysis reviews matter towards the success of movie.
Also interms of production microsoft should invest with the best performing studios to produce films since we have seen alot of returns from the best studios according to box office. The studios highly recommended are BV,Universal,WB,FOX AND Sony respectively.
Also we recommend microsoft to apply same strategies applied by the best performing movies in the box office. Movies such as Avatar,Star Wars,Avengers and Beauty and the beast are the best performing movies as per box office.
